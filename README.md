# GYAN_Summarization_Task

To complete this task we used CNN/DailyMail dataset version 3.
In this task we compare pipelines of Baseline transformer, GPT-2, T5, BART, Pegasus with it's ROGUE metric on a limited amount of train dataset.
We find that Pegasus has the best ROGUE metric score when tested on the train dataset.
Because it was shown that Pegasus had the best ROGUE metric score, we use it on the test dataset summarization and we present the ROGUE metric to complete the task.
